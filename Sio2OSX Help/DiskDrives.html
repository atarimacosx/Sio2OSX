The Media Status Window on the Atari800MacX emulator allows you to

control all of the aspects of digital media emulation from one

graphical interface.&nbsp; Besides media management, it allow you

to

control some often used aspects of the emulator as well.&nbsp; If

it is

not displayed at the moment, you can display if by issuing the "Show

Media Status Window" command in the Media menu.&nbsp; The media

status

window looks like this:<br>







<br>







<b><u>Drive Status sections:</u></b><br>







<br>







<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="DiskDriveStatus.png" alt="Atari800MacX Media Status Window" style="width: 322px; height: 96px;"><br>







<br>







The main section of the Sio2OSX window displays 8 disk drives which

each allow you to control one of Sio2OSX's emualted

disk drives.&nbsp; The drive may be turned on/off with

the

on/off button.&nbsp; If the drive is on, you may insert a disk

image or Macintosh directory (see the paragraph on "Sharepoints" later

in this section) by

pressing the Insert button.&nbsp; You also can drag and drop a disk

image file or folder from the Finder to the drive picture to insert the

disk.&nbsp; When an image is inserted, you can write

protect/unprotect

it with the Lock/Unlock button.&nbsp; When the drive is write

protected, a

small lock icon will appear above the lock button.&nbsp; Finally,

you

can drag disks/directories from one drive to another.<br><br>Three
types of disk image files are support. &nbsp;The standard .atr is
supported, along with VAPI's .atx files, and .pro copy protected
images. &nbsp;VAPI support does not work correctly for all image files
currently in circulation, but supports 95% of them. &nbsp;See <a href="ReleaseHistory.html">Release History</a> for those images known not to work.<br>







<br>







Status/Activity will also be displayed by the drives.&nbsp; The

on/off,

insert/eject, and lock/unlock buttons will light up/darken when disks

are inserted/removed, etc.&nbsp; Also, there are two LED's on the

drive.&nbsp; One indicates power, and the second indicates

read/write

activity, red for write, and green for read.&nbsp; In addition, the

sector the drive is reading or writing will be shown on the disk drive

door. <br>







<br>







If you are using a real disk drive in the SIO chain along with the

Sio2PC cable, you should leave the Sio2OSX drive with the same drive

number as the real drive turned off, so that Sio2OSX does not try to

respond to commands intended for the real disk drive.<br>







<br>







</div>







<b><u>"Sharepoints":</u></b><br>







<br>





<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Besides using ATR disk images, Sio2OSX

also allows the Atari to access files directly in Mac directories, or a

share point. &nbsp;This will allow ANY Dos on the Atari (even those

that can't handle large drives, such as Atari Dos 2.x) to directly read

and write Macintosh files. &nbsp;In addition, you can change

directories from the Atari by "accessing" the directory file you want

to change into. &nbsp;In Atari DOS or MyDos this means doing a binary

load on the file, in Spartados you can simply type the directory name

or the directory name followed by a '.' if there is not extension. If

you do a directory from the Atari, you will notice a special file as

the first one listed, and it is named "UP". &nbsp;Accessing this file

will move you up one directory on the Macintosh.<br>





<br>





There are several limitations to this direct file access, and they are the following:<br>





<ul>





  <li>Only the first 62 files present in the selected Macintosh

directory are accessible from the Atari. &nbsp;This is due to the 64

file limitation on files in a directory on Atari DOS's. &nbsp;From

this, one directory entry is reserved for the "UP" directory, and one

entry is reserved for allowing the Atari to create and write to a new

file.</li>





  <li>Only one file may be written to, and one file read from at a time.</li>





  <li>Macintosh filenames will be translated to the 8.3 format used for

Atari filenames. &nbsp;This may lead to what appears to be duplicate

filenames from the Atari if you are not careful in naming your files.</li>





  <li>The size of a file that may be written is limited to

approximately 78 Kilobytes. &nbsp;If you need to transfer larger files

to a Macintosh directory, you will need to write them to a disk image,

and then use the ATR disk editor from Atari800MacX or a similar program

to transfer the file from the disk image to the Macintosh directory.</li>





</ul>

<b><u>Disk Image pushbuttons:</u><br>







</b>

<blockquote><img src="DiskButtons.png" alt="Disk Image Buttons" style="width: 218px; height: 96px;"><br>







  <br>







This section of the window provides pushbuttons alllowing you to access

some of the common disk functions that are&nbsp;available in the

Disks menu.<br>







  <br>







  <b><u>Save Disk Set Button<br>







  <br>







  </u></b>

  

  

  <blockquote>This button allows the user to save the names of

the

disk

images

that are currently in the drives to a file, to be loaded later.

&nbsp;The

file that the set is save in has an extension of ".set", and it is a

human

readable text file, containing the paths of the image files, or "Empty"

or

"Off" for a drive that has no disk.<br>







  </blockquote>







  <b><u>Load Disk Set Button<br>







  <br>







  </u></b>

  

  

  <blockquote>This button allows the user to load a disk set

saved

earlier

with the Save Disk Set Button. &nbsp;The user is allowed to browse

for

the

set file, displaying files ending in ".set". &nbsp;Sio2OSX

then

loads

the disk images specified in the file into the corresponding drives.

&nbsp;If

a drive in the set file is "Empty" or "Off", no changes are made to the

drive.

&nbsp; This allows the user to load multiple disk sets sequentially.<br>







  </blockquote>







  <b><u>Rotate Disks Button<br>







  </u></b>

  

  

  <blockquote>This button rotates the current inserted floppies

among the

drives.&nbsp; This may be useful for playing multiple disk games.<br>







  </blockquote>







  <u><b>New Disk Image Button<br>







  <br>







  </b></u>

  

  

  <blockquote>This button will display a new window which you may

use to

create a new disk image (.atr only). &nbsp;This new image will be saved in .atr

format.<br>







    <br>







In the Create Disk Image window,&nbsp; you may choose a format of a

disk. Note that not all formats are supported by all Atari DOSes. There

are three standard formats:<br>







    

    

    <ul>







      <li>Single density (40 tracks * 18 sectors/track * 128

bytes/sector

= 90 KB)</li>







      <li>Medium density (40 tracks * 26 sectors/track * 128

bytes/sector

= 130 KB)</li>







      <li>Double density (40 tracks * 18 sectors/track * 256

bytes/sector

= 180 KB)</li>







    

    

    </ul>







You can also select any other format, by clicking Custom and setting

Number of sectors and Bytes per sector. Please make sure your Atari DOS

supports this format, otherwise the image will be unusable.<br>







    <br>







If 256 bytes per sector are selected, you can choose between 128 and

256 Bytes in boot sectors. Physically, boot sectors (first three

sectors on

a disk) are also 256 bytes long, but only 128 are transmitted between

the

Atari and a disk drive (upper halves of sectors are not used). There

are

disk images with 128 bytes in boot sectors and disk images with 256

bytes

in boot sectors. Sio2OSX supports both, but other

emulators

don't. Except some special cases, we recommend 128 for ATR images.<br>







    <br>







If the "Insert New Disk image into drive" checkbox is checked, the

created image will be mounted on the specified drive.<br>

<b><u>Disk Menu:</u></b><br>







<blockquote><img src="DiskMenu.png" alt="Disk Image Buttons" style="width: 293px; height: 146px;"><br>







  <br>







The Disks menu on Sio2OSX allows you to insert and

remove digital media into the emulator, the same way you would on a

real Atari. &nbsp;It

has the following menu selections:<br>

  <br>

  <b><u>Insert Floppy (cmd-1 through cmd-8)</u><br>













  </b>

  <blockquote>This sub-menu allows you to insert an image file or a Mac folder (as a Sharepoint) into any

of the

8 emulated disk drives. &nbsp;A .atr, .dcm, or .xfd file may also be

loaded

into Sio2OSX by double-clicking it in the finder, or dragging it

to

the&nbsp;Sio2OSX Icon.<br>













  </blockquote>













  <b><u>Remove Floppy (ctrl-cmd-1 through ctrl-cmd-8, and ctrl-cmd-0)</u><br>













  </b>

  <blockquote>This sub-menu allows you to remove a image file or Sharepoint from one of

the emulated disk drives, or you may empty all of the drives at once.<br>













  </blockquote>













  <b><u>Rotate Floppies<br>













  </u></b>

  <blockquote>This menu item rotates the current inserted floppies among

the drives.&nbsp; This may be useful for playing multiple disk games.<br>

  </blockquote>

  <b><u>Save Disk Set Button<br>







  <br>







  </u></b>

  

  

  <blockquote>This&nbsp;menu item allows the user to save the names of

the
